# 📡 Node.js Exercises

## 📝 What I Learned from These Exercises

Through these **Node.js exercises**, I practiced and reinforced key concepts, including command-line arguments, file handling, web servers, and recursion.

### 🏷️ Node.js & JavaScript Concepts
- **Command-Line Arguments:** Processed inputs using `process.argv`.
- **File System Module (`fs`)**: Read and wrote data from files.
- **HTTP Module:** Created a basic web server with routing.
- **Recursion:** Implemented recursive directory traversal.

### 🎨 Code Structure & Organization
- Wrote **clean and modular** scripts for better readability.
- Used **helper functions** to simplify operations.
- Followed **consistent coding patterns** across exercises.

### 🔢 Implemented Functionalities
- **Sum of Two Numbers:** Added two numbers from command-line arguments.
- **Even or Odd Checker:** Determined if a number is even or odd.
- **String Reversal:** Reversed an input string.
- **Multiplication Table:** Printed multiplication tables up to 10.
- **File Statistics:** Retrieved size, creation date, and last modified date of a file.
- **Filtering an Array of Objects:** Extracted users older than a given age.
- **Simple Web Server:** Served different content for `/`, `/about`, and `/contact` routes.
- **Recursive Directory Traversal:** Listed all files and directories within a given path.

### 🚀 Error Handling & Validation
- Used **input validation** to ensure correct values were provided.
- Implemented **error handling** for file operations and HTTP requests.
- Ensured **proper status codes** in the web server.

### 📱 Future Enhancements
- Implement **environment variables** for better configuration.
- Improve **error handling** with better logging mechanisms.
- Extend the web server to support **dynamic content and database connections**.
