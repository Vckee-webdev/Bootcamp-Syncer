# 🖼️ Image Slider  

## 📝 What I Learned from This Project  

While creating this **Image Slider Webpage** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, I learned and practiced the following:  

### 🏷️ HTML Tags  
- **`<img>` Tag:** Used to display images in the slider.  
- **`<button>` Tag:** Used for navigation (Next, Previous).  
- **`<div>` Tag:** Used to structure the slider container.  
- **`<script>` Tag:** Used to include JavaScript functionality.  

### 🎨 CSS Concepts  
- Styled the **slider container** for a clean and centered look.  
- Applied **CSS transitions** for smooth image changes.  
- Used **positioning and flexbox** to align navigation buttons.  

### 🔄 JavaScript Functionality  
- Implemented **event listeners** for next and previous buttons.  
- Used **arrays** to store and cycle through images.  
- Applied **DOM manipulation (`document.getElementById()`)** to update the displayed image.  
- Ensured images loop continuously when reaching the first or last image.  

### 📱 Responsive Design  
- Ensured the slider adapts to **different screen sizes**.  
- Used **media queries** for mobile-friendly navigation buttons.  

### 🚀 Additional Skills  
- Created a **dynamic image carousel**.  
- Improved **user experience** with smooth transitions.  
- Learned **basic JavaScript logic for image navigation**.
