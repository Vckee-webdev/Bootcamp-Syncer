# ✅ To-Do List App  

## 📝 What I Learned from This Project  

While creating this **To-Do List App** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, I learned and practiced the following:  

### 🏷️ HTML Tags  
- **`<input>` Tag:** Used to enter new to-do items.  
- **`<button>` Tag:** Used to add, mark complete, and remove items.  
- **`<ul>` and `<li>` Tags:** Used to structure the list of tasks.  
- **`<script>` Tag:** Used for adding dynamic functionality with JavaScript.  

### 🎨 CSS Concepts  
- Styled the **to-do list items** for clear visibility.  
- Designed **buttons with hover effects** for a better user experience.  
- Used **CSS classes** to visually indicate completed tasks.  
- Applied **flexbox for proper layout and alignment**.  

### 🔄 JavaScript Functionality  
- Implemented **event listeners** to handle user interactions.  
- Used **`document.createElement()`** to dynamically add list items.  
- Allowed **marking items as complete** with a strikethrough effect.  
- Enabled **removal of items** from the list dynamically.  
- Stored tasks in **local storage** to persist data across page reloads.  

### 📱 Responsive Design  
- Ensured the app is **mobile-friendly and adapts to different screen sizes**.  
- Used **media queries** to adjust spacing and font sizes on smaller screens.  

### 🚀 Additional Skills  
- Improved **JavaScript DOM manipulation** for real-time updates.  
- Enhanced **UI/UX with smooth transitions and visual feedback**.  
- Learned how to **handle user inputs efficiently** in a web application.
