# 🧮 Simple Calculator  

## 📝 What I Learned from This Project  

While creating this **Calculator** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, I learned and practiced the following:  

### 🏷️ HTML Tags  
- **`<input>` Tag:** Used to display the entered numbers and results.  
- **`<button>` Tag:** Used for numbers (0-9) and mathematical operations (+, -, *, /).  
- **`<div>` Tag:** Used for structuring the calculator layout.  

### 🎨 CSS Concepts  
- Styled the **calculator display and buttons** for a clean and modern look.  
- Used **grid layout** to arrange buttons neatly.  
- Applied **hover effects** to enhance user interaction.  
- Ensured **proper spacing and alignment** for a professional appearance.  

### 🔢 JavaScript Functionality  
- Implemented **event listeners** to handle button clicks.  
- Used **`eval()` (or safer alternatives) to perform calculations** dynamically.  
- Allowed **clearing the display** when needed.  
- Handled **error cases (e.g., division by zero)** gracefully.  

### 📱 Responsive Design  
- Ensured the calculator adapts to **different screen sizes** (desktop, tablet, mobile).  
- Used **media queries** to adjust button sizes and layout on smaller screens.  

### 🚀 Additional Skills  
- Improved **JavaScript DOM manipulation** for real-time updates.  
- Enhanced **UI/UX with smooth transitions and intuitive design**.  
- Learned how to **handle mathematical operations efficiently** in a web application.
