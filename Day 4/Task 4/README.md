# 🔲 Modal Popup  

## 📝 What I Learned from This Project  

While creating this **Modal Popup Window** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, I learned and practiced the following:  

### 🏷️ HTML Tags  
- **`<button>` Tag:** Used to open and close the modal.  
- **`<div>` Tag:** Used to create the modal container and overlay.  
- **`<span>` Tag:** Used for the close button inside the modal.  
- **`<script>` Tag:** Used to handle modal functionality with JavaScript.  

### 🎨 CSS Concepts  
- Styled the **modal container** for a clean and centered look.  
- Used **positioning and opacity transitions** for smooth animations.  
- Applied **CSS overlays** to dim the background when the modal is active.  

### 🔄 JavaScript Functionality  
- Implemented **event listeners** to open and close the modal.  
- Used **`display: block` and `display: none`** to toggle visibility.  
- Applied **`document.getElementById()`** for DOM manipulation.  

### 📱 Responsive Design  
- Ensured the modal adapts properly to **different screen sizes**.  
- Used **media queries** to adjust modal width and positioning on smaller screens.  

### 🚀 Additional Skills  
- Improved **UI/UX design** with smooth opening/closing effects.  
- Learned how to create **interactive popups** with minimal JavaScript.  
- Enhanced **user experience** by preventing background scrolling when the modal is active.

📌 **Next Steps:** Add animations, different modal themes, and keyboard support for closing with the "Escape" key!
