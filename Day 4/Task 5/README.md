# ⏱️ Timer & Stopwatch  

## 📝 What I Learned from This Project  

While creating this **Timer & Stopwatch** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, I learned and practiced the following:  

### 🏷️ HTML Tags  
- **`<button>` Tag:** Used for Start, Stop, and Reset controls.  
- **`<div>` Tag:** Used to display the timer/stopwatch.  
- **`<script>` Tag:** Used for implementing timer logic with JavaScript.  

### 🎨 CSS Concepts  
- Styled the **timer display** for better readability.  
- Designed **buttons with hover effects** for better UI/UX.  
- Used **flexbox** to center elements and create a structured layout.  

### 🔄 JavaScript Functionality  
- Used **`setInterval()`** to update the timer every second.  
- Implemented **Start, Stop, and Reset functionalities** for control.  
- Utilized **DOM manipulation (`document.getElementById()`)** to update the displayed time.  
- Ensured **proper time formatting** (hours, minutes, seconds).  

### 📱 Responsive Design  
- Ensured the layout adapts well on **different screen sizes**.  
- Used **media queries** to adjust button and text sizes on mobile.  

### 🚀 Additional Skills  
- Built a **functional stopwatch that counts up** and a **timer that counts down**.  
- Improved **JavaScript event handling** for user interactions.  
- Enhanced **UI/UX with interactive buttons and real-time updates**.
